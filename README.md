# Theme Goals

This is my final attempt at a custom theme before declaring theme bankrupcy. Here is what I set out to design:

- Usable day and night
- Minimal syntax highlighting, not being on either extreme. I have tried fully monochrome and fruit salad themes and neither have convinced me.
- Decent contrast - I want to be able to discern colors but without them popping too much.
- Provide extras for other tools

### Rust with some diagnostics

## Inspiration

The colors are taken straight out of [palefire-vscode](https://github.com/matklad/pale-fire) which in turn is inspired by zenburn.
I have only adapted the syntax highlights to my preferences which will likely be changing.

## Future work

- Iterate on UI colors.
- Iterate on language/treesitter/lsp specific highlights for cohesion.
